# NVIDIA Deep Learning Labs
These labs are hands-on python labs designed to teach students the fundamentals of Deep Learning by allowing students to build and train very simple Artificial Neural Networks. Additional labs discuss Transformer architecture and Natural Language Processing


## Lab 1 - Creating and Training a Neural Network on MNIST dataset
This lab is considered the "Hello World" of neural networks.  Before I could follow along and understand what each line of code was doing, I had to spend several hours to understand fundamental concepts associated in this lab:
- Matrices, Scaler vs. Vector vs. Tensor dimensions, y = mx+b (slope intercept) and why it matters in our training
- Python specific topics such as, using PIL for images, argmax, MNIST dataset and why device assignments (CPU vs GPU) can be beneficial when processing tensors
- PyTorch fundamentals: nn.Sequential, nn.Linear, nn.Flatten, 
- What is an Activation function and the popular types (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh, Softmax)
- What are Optimizers and the popular types (Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, SGD)
- Non-mathematical theory of gradient descent and how it helps model adjust the weight in the optimizers
- What is a Loss function and popular types (Mean Squared Error, RootMSE)
- Lab outcome: 
    - Epochs: 5
    - Training - Loss: 62.98, Accuracy:98.89%
    - Validation - Loss: 23.56, Accuracy: 97.98%


## Lab 2 - Creating and Training a Neural Network on American Sign Language dataset
This lab uses American Sign Language(ASL) image dataset to train a model.  The objective is to demonstrate that you may achieve high accuracy with training data, but when running the validation data, the model does not perform well (Overfits).  
- Lab outcome: 
    - Epochs: 20
    - Training - Loss: 11.05, Accuracy:99.66%
    - Validation - Loss: 220.91, Accuracy: 81.64%


## Lab 3 - Creating a simple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for ASL dataset
This lab applies CNN techniques on the ASL model to improve accuracy.
In this lab I learned:
- CNN fundamentals: Regularization, Data Augmentation, Kernel, Stride, Max Pooling, Padding, Dropout
- PyTorch: nn.Conv2d, nn.MaxPool2d, nn.Dropout
- Lab outcome: 
    - Epochs: 20
    - Training - Loss: 00.81, Accuracy:99.66%
    - Validation - Loss: 24.51, Accuracy: 97.49%


## Lab 4 A - Using the prior CNN model and augmenting the data
- Data augmentation: Further reducing the loss and increasing the accuracy of the model  by increased size of image quantiy (augmented image data), which provides the model variance in patterns.  Image augmentation should consider the reality of augmented data, for example, an inverse ASL image is not realistic while slightly tilted are ok.

- Lab outcome: 
    - Epochs: 20
    - Training - Loss: 12.28 Accuracy: 99.59%
    - Validation - Loss: 7.49 Accuracy: 98.76%
